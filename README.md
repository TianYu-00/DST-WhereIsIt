# DST-WhereIsIt

**Where Is It**

**Where Is It** is a practical mod for **Don't Starve Together** that helps players quickly locate creatures, resources, and other entities in the game world. The mod provides a menu interface with a smooth scroll bar, allowing players to freely browse, search, add, or remove entities. Once a target is selected, a directional beam will point towards the specified location. Any entities added by the player will be saved across sessions.

Inspired by [**Where You Are?**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823963520&searchtext=Where+you+are), but mod was coded from scratch.

**在哪里**

**Where Is It** 是一款适用于**饥荒联机版**的实用模组，可帮助玩家快速定位游戏世界中的生物、资源及其他实体。该模组提供带平滑滚动条的菜单界面，允许玩家自由浏览、搜索、添加或移除实体。当选中目标后，方向光束将指向指定位置。玩家添加的任何实体都将被保存。

受[**Where You Are?**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823963520&searchtext=Where+you+are)启发，可是模组是从零开始编写的。
