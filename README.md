# DST-WhereIsIt

## TO DO LIST
- [x] Features
    - [x] Custom menu screen
    - [x] Find entities 
    - [x] Directional beam
    - [x] Menu scroller
    - [ ] Search bar
    - [ ] Add entity to menu
    - [ ] Save that entity with TheSim:GetPersistentString/TheSim:SetSetting maybe. Need to look into this more

How do i go about doing the add entity to menu?
- input textbox could work for search and entity name to add ✅
- 2 buttons 1 for search 1 for add ✅
- add needs delete too so the entity could be removed from menu


Also found a better alternative to worldgen_customization and worldsettings_customization icons
use scrapbook icons instead `databundles/images/images/scrapbook_icons1` 2 and 3
