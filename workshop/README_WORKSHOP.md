[h1]Where Is It[/h1]

[b]Where Is It[/b] is a utility mod for [b]Don't Starve Together[/b] tthat helps players quickly locate creatures, resources, and other entities in the game world. The mod provides a menu interface with a smooth scroll bar, allowing players to freely browse, search, add, remove or favourite entities. Once a target is selected, a directional beam will point towards the specified location. Any entities that the player add will persist across different servers if the "Where Is It" mod is installed.

Inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823963520&searchtext=Where+you+are][b]Where You Are?[/b][/url], but mod was coded from scratch.
