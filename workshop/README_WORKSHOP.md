[h1]Where Is It[/h1]

Where Is It is a quality-of-life mod for Don't Starve Together that makes finding entities much easier. It adds a searchable entity menu with fuzzy search, lets you add and remove custom entities, and gives you the ability to pin important ones so they always appear first. Selecting an entity highlights its location with a directional arrow, helping you quickly track it down in the world.

The mod also features fully customizable hotkeys that can be changed at any time during gameplay. All of your settings, including hotkeys and custom entities, are saved persistently between servers, so your preferences carry over seamlessly across different worlds and sessions.

Inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823963520&searchtext=Where+you+are][b]Where You Are?[/b][/url], but mod was coded from scratch.

[h2] v1.4.0 Update Notice [/h2]

《Where Is It》是一款专为《饥荒：联机版》打造的实用性模组，让寻找各种物体更加轻松。它提供模糊搜索的实体菜单，让你快速找到目标，还能自由添加或移除自定义实体，并支持将常用或重要的实体置顶，方便随时使用。点击菜单中的实体后，屏幕上会出现方向箭头，指引你前往它所在的位置，再也不用担心迷路或找不到东西。

模组还支持自定义快捷键，并且可以在游戏过程中随时修改。无论是快捷键设置还是自定义实体，都会被自动保存，并在不同的服务器和世界中保持一致，让你的游戏体验更加顺手和省心。

受[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823963520&searchtext=Where+you+are][b]Where You Are?[/b][/url]启发，可是模组是从零开始编写的。

[h2] v1.4.0 更新公告 [/h2]
所有快建现已移至游戏内。
默认打开菜单的键位为“O”。
